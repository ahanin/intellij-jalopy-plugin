IntelliJ Jalopy Formatter Plugin
================================

I just found that my 'go to' Jalopy plugin for IDEA didn't work with version 12, and it seemed that is wasn't supported
  anymore. So, I went with implementing my own. The same functionality, but without some bugs I found during using
  the other one, and nice automatic formatting feature on document save.

Usage
-----

Use Ctrl+Shift+P to format currently active document, or alternatively, enable automatic formatting on save in
plugin configuration.

Compatibility
-------------
Compatible with IntelliJ IDEA 12.
